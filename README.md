# GAMES101-Assignments

The pure assignments of GAMES101.

All of my work will be done on other branchs, so the master branch is a clean version, you can just fork it and do it by yourself.

> About env config: I'm using archlinux, so just use yay to install every missing lib like qt5-base, vtk, hdf, fmt, opencv, eigen.
